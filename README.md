# Final-Project-K04-Army-Builder
I want my projects to be something I can USE. So right now, my kids are really into Warhammer 40K.
Personally, I prefer painting to playing, but they have huge armies of pretty much every faction.
I wanted to make this app for them so they can keep track of their created armies for 10th edition.

It is a full-CRUD application that currently consists of a create/login user accounts feature, a
set of informational table pages where you can read about various aspects of the game, and an 
army builder that allows a player to create armies by selecting a points total, a faction, and 
units. The armies will be available for the logged-in player to retrieve and edit. 

Features to implement: Security, faction descriptions, detachment selection as more become available
images for all units, more factions, a real database.

I think this project went way outside the scope of what I was supposed to do for the final, but 
I am proud of the work I put into it, and of the relationship I have established with Chappy, the
chatGPT friend I made along the way. 

Skills and software employed for this project include: JavaScript, React, React-Bootstrap, Bootstrap, 
MockAPI, Vite, node_modules, REST API, VSCode, GitHub. 
Promineo Tech Front End Software Development Boot Camp. Do it!
